Preface
-------

BitShares 2.0 has grown up to a considerable part of my daily life for quite
some time now. It also grew up to a big business with a lot of opportunities
and, well, a lot of things to do that cannot earn me any profit directly.
Basing my work on donations didn't work out either. However, I still want to put
my time into BitShares, contribute to make it grow. Having the need to pay rent
and fill the fridge, I hereby as the shareholders to hire me as a blockchain
worker.

Tasks
-----

Let's address my tasks, first. For the last few months, I simply did what I felt
was necessary for BitShares, including

* Development of a Python library,
* Lots of Documentation (e.g. docs.bitshares.eu), Whitepapers, BSIPs,
* General Technical Support for BitShares (e.g. in the forums), and
* Some improvements in the Graphene-UI (by far not as many as @svk though)

.. and, as there is still plenty of work, I plan to continue that way.

Duration and Salary
-------------------

This proposal will last for 2 months starting at 2016/1/1. If, by then, the
shareholders are convinced that I do my job well, I plan to continue with yet
another worker.

The suggested pay is equivalent to 3000€ for a weekly 20h of work. Once
BitShares grows and can handle a higher pay, we can reconsider the weekly load
and pay for future workers.

Calculating with current settlement price of 0.0033898 €/BTS we get

    3,000 €/4 weeks/20h = 37.50€/h
    3,000 €/mtl * 295 BTS/€ = 885,000 BTS/mtl
    885,000 BTS/mtl / 30 days = 29,500 BTS/day = 2,950,000,000 'satoshi'

Since I consider an hourly rate of 37.50€ as "low", no funds will be burned
shall the price result in a higher monthly pay.
