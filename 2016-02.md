# Worker Proposal

BitShares 2.0 has come a long way and is heading towards one of the most robust, and flexible ecosystems that mankind has yet seen. However, quite some auxiliary work has yet to be done and I would like to offer my time and expertise and continue contributing to the BitShares ecosystems on many different fronts.

## Summary of previous work

As of this writing, I have had an active worker for the **first 6 weeks of 2016** and have achieved the following goals:

1. **Python Library**:
 * 136 commits
 * added lines: 8699 removed lines: 5716 total lines: 2983
2. **Documentation**:
  * 55 commits
  * added lines: 4396 removed lines: 1361 total lines: 3035
3. **GUI**:
  * 6 commits
  * added lines: 257 removed lines: 184 total lines: 73
4. **BSIPs**:
  * 6 commits 
  * added lines: 49 removed lines: 52 total lines: -3
5. **Committee/Proposals**:
  * 14 commits
  * added lines: 644 removed lines: 165 total lines: 479
6. **Committee/Instructions**:
  * 39 commits
  * added lines: 2893 removed lines: 494 total lines: 2399
7. **Testnet**:
  * Setup of a full-featured public testnet

Other work, such as github comments, telegram discussions as well as forum support and participation are not enumerable, easily.

Basing my previous and current work and given that I want to put further time into BitShares, I hereby apply for another **subsequent** blockchain worker.

## Shareholder Summary

Since my current worker will terminate by end of February, but I still want to contribute on a very regular and intensive basis to make BitShares a success, I hereby propose **consecutive** workers that will has its beginning date after the current worker terminates (e.g. 1st of March). To give shareholders a means of distinguishing work, I propose two distinct workers (More details below). Further, for tax reasons, this worker will be created by the account `pay.xeroc` instead of `xeroc`. Last but not least, another difference to my previous worker is that both will have a **90 days vesting period**.

## Distinct Workers

This proposal applies for **two distinct workers** in BitShares for a **total of 20h work per week**. The offer follows this distribution:

* If **both** workers are approved:

  A total of 20h per week will be contributed to reach completion of both workers and the results will be delivered as public good.

* If **one** of both workers is approved:

  A total of 10h per week will be contributed to reach completion of the approved worker and will be delivered as public good. Services delivered that correspond to the *unapproved* worker will carry a price tag.

* If **none** of the workers is approved:

  No further contributions will be delivered as public good. Individual services that have been paid by workers earlier will carry a price tag.

## Worker 1: Documentation and Technical Support

This proposal will last for 4 months starting at 2016/3/1. The suggested pay for this workers is equivalent to 1000€ for a weekly 10h of work. Calculating with current settlement price of 0.00300 €/BTS we get

    1,000 €/4 weeks/10h = 25,00€/h
    1,000 €/mtl * 322 BTS/€ = 322,000 BTS/mtl
    322,000 BTS/mtl / 30 days = 10733.33333 BTS/day

Thus each worker will have a daily pay of 1,073,333,333 'satoshi'.

Since an hourly rate of 25.00€ as considered "low", given the knowledge required to fulfill this job, no funds will be burned shall the price result in a higher monthly pay.

### Tasks

#### Documentation

* Improving the Integration Docs
  Adding more details for ways to integrate. Looking at different businesses like exchange, merchants, traders, etc.
* Improving the API Docs
  Since the API is rather complex, we need to put way more thoughts into how to educate people on the differences of a central API and a decentralized API.
* Improving the User Guide
  There is a lot of work still to be done such as multi-signature tutorials, account setting tutorials and descriptions, and many more.
* Improving GUI built-in documentation
  The GUI has its own help pages which are very basic currently and quite some features are not explained to the end user yet.
* Maintaining BSIPs
  Improving the BitShares protocol needs way more structure and guidelines as well as solid formal descriptions. These need to evolve and grow over time and thus quite some time needs to be put into BSIPs.

#### Technical Support

* General Technical Support for BitShares in the forums
  As the main contributor in the BitSharesTalk forums, many (english speaking) shareholders already know my friendly and welcome way to help new comers and assist development.
* Supportive Tasks for Witnesses (scripting)
  Witnesses need tools to maintain their operations. Some of them already exist and are done, some others need constant improvements and feature integration.
* Supportive Tasks for Committee (organization, fee schedules, statistics)
  Since the discussions about the fee schedule, quite some questions stayed unanswered. Many of those answers could be obtained from statistics about the revenue of the DAC. I'd like to help figure out these numbers and help improve the business plan of our DAC.

## Worker 2: Python Library and Applications

This proposal will last for 4 months starting at 2016/3/1. The suggested pay for this workers is equivalent to 2000€ for a weekly 10h of work. Calculating with current settlement price of 0.00300 €/BTS we get

    2,000 €/4 weeks/10h = 50,00€/h
    2,000 €/mtl * 322 BTS/€ = 644,000 BTS/mtl
    644,000 BTS/mtl / 30 days = 21,466.66666 BTS/day/worker

Thus each worker will have a daily pay of 2,146,666,666 'satoshi'.

### Tasks

#### Python Library

* Exchange API (for easy integration of the dex)
* Serialisation and Signing of Transactions (for offline-signing)
* Prediction Market Library (for managing PMs)
* Proposal Library (for managing Proposals)

#### Applications

* Infrastructure for Automated Trading Algorithms
* Indexed Blockchain Mongo Database
* Statistical Analysis Transaction and Fees
* Message Signing Tools
