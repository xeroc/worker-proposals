Dear Shareholder,

you receive this message because you have set the account "xeroc" as your voting
proxy in BitShares.

First, of all, I would like to thank you for the confidence and trust you have
in me.

However, I see the need to inform you about the decision I made to vote for my
own worker proposal going forward. You can find the details of it in
[github](https://github.com/xeroc/worker-proposals). In summary, the current
proposal would pay me roughly 3000â‚¬ for 20h/week of work during January and
February. After that time, a new proposal will be made with similar pay (Euro
denominated) to keep my BitShares related work funded. It is of great importance
to me to let you know about this conflicting interests!

To give you enough time to reconsider and change your voting proxy, I will *not*
vote for my proposal until Monday next week (28th of December).

Sincerely Yours
 -- Fabian Schuh a.k.a. xeroc
